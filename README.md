# Hi, I'm Dhananjay 👋

I'm a computer science student looking for a job as remote intern or part- time job, where I can apply my knowledge. Constantly learning in the field of Computer Science and Graphic Designing. I am regular, punctual and hard-working student. One and only quote I use while performing tasks -“I found technology to explore myself”.
